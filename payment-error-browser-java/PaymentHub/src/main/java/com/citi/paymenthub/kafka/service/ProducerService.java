For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber.

At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types.

For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops.

For the diet that abstains from animal products and consists mostly of plants see Veganism. For a vegetarian diet see Vegetarianism. For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations.

For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops.

For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber.

It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops. Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber. Many nutritionists encourage people to consume plenty of fruit and vegetables five or more portions a day often being recommended.Veggie redirects here.

Depending on the type of vegetable concerned harvesting the crop is followed by grading storing processing and marketing.Vegetables can be eaten either raw or cooked and play an important role in human nutrition being mostly low in fat and carbohydrates but high in vitamins minerals and dietary fiber.

For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations.

For the diet that abstains from animal products and consists mostly of plants see Veganism. For a vegetarian diet see Vegetarianism. For other uses see Vegetable disambiguation.Vegetables in a market in the PhilippinesVegetables are parts of plants that are consumed by humans as food as part of a meal. The original meaning is still commonly used and is applied to plants collectively to refer to all edible plant matter including the flowers fruits stems leaves roots and seeds. The alternate definition of the term vegetable is applied somewhat arbitrarily often by culinary and cultural tradition. It may exclude foods derived from some plants that are fruits nuts and cereal grains but include fruits from others such as tomatoes and courgettes and seeds such as pulses.Originally vegetables were collected from the wild by huntergatherers and entered cultivation in several parts of the world probably during the period 10000 BC to 7000 BC when a new agricultural way of life developed. At first plants which grew locally would have been cultivated but as time went on trade brought exotic crops from elsewhere to add to domestic types. Nowadays most vegetables are grown all over the world as climate permits and crops may be cultivated in protected environments in less suitable locations. China is the largest producer of vegetables and global trade in agricultural products allows consumers to purchase vegetables grown in faraway countries. The scale of production varies from subsistence farmers supplying the needs of their family for food to agribusinesses with vast acreages of singleproduct crops.
